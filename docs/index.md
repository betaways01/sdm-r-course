## Course Overview 🌍

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are powerful tools for understanding where species are likely to occur based on environmental variables. They play a crucial role in:

- **Biodiversity conservation**
- **Ecological research**
- **Environmental management**

### Core Topics Covered

1. **Theoretical Framework:**
   - Learn the fundamental principles of SDMs, including ecological niche theory and predictor variables.

2. **Spatial Data Handling:**
   - Gain hands-on experience with spatial datasets in R (e.g., shapefiles, raster data).

3. **Modeling Algorithms:**
   - Explore different SDM algorithms, such as:
     - **MaxEnt:** For presence-only data.
     - **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** and **Random Forests (RF)** for presence-absence data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use metrics like AUC, TSS, and Kappa to assess model performance.

5. **Projection & Scenario Analysis:**
   - Predict species distributions under future climate scenarios using ensemble modeling.
